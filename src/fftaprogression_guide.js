The Moogle responds with a humorous confirmation before explaining that the armored figure nearby is a Judge, responsible for enforcing daily combat laws. Today’s law prohibits the use of items, and the Moogle advises Marche to always review the law before fighting. Before long, it’s your turn to act.

Think back to the Snowball Fight — an engagement works almost the same way. You currently play as a Soldier equipped with a Shortsword. Move toward the Bangaa, ideally attacking from the side or rear to improve your hit rate, and select “Fight.” The Moogle — whose name you’ll soon learn is Montblanc — fights as a Black Mage and will cast elemental spells. This encounter is straightforward: defeat both Bangaas to claim victory.

During the fight, you’ll also be introduced to Judge Points. Montblanc will explain that these points let you perform combo attacks alongside your allies, though later in the game, they’ll serve another purpose related to Totemas.

This fight is quite manageable, so there’s no need to rush. The Goblins are weak and easily defeated, but keep an eye on the Red Cap, as it can pose a bit more of a challenge. Have Montblanc target it with Black Magic to take it down efficiently. Save the Sprite for last — it doesn’t use any special abilities and its regular attacks cause very little damage.

At the top of the battlefield are a White Mage and a level 4 Thief. You won’t be able to reach them immediately, but make them your priority once you can. The stronger Thief possesses the Reaction ability *Counter*, which may be new to you. To avoid triggering it, rely on ranged attacks such as Montblanc’s Black Magic or your Archer’s shots.

The Soldiers in this fight tend to use *Mug* and standard sword attacks — their strikes can deal solid damage, but it’s best to save them for last. Focus on eliminating the Archer early before it can start using *Aim: Arm* or *Aim: Legs* to disable your party members. Once all enemies have been defeated, the mission will be complete and Dalilei’s thesis will be safely recovered.

You probably don’t need a White Mage here. You can bring one if you’re unsure about your lineup, but knockouts are unlikely if you play cleanly. You only get three additional clan slots, so use them wisely. Open by eliminating the enemy White Mage. Next, remove the Archer before it starts locking down your team with immobilize or disable shots. The Thief and Fighter look scary but aren’t much of a threat in this encounter. After the Archer, shift attention to the White Monk, then mop up the rest at your pace. Overall, it’s a relaxed win.

This fight can be challenging given how early it appears in the game. At this stage, your available jobs are likely still basic ones such as Soldier and Archer. The biggest threats here are the Panther-type enemies: two Red Panthers and one Coeurl, which is the stronger blue variant. All three have high attack and defense stats, so handle them carefully. If your Archer has learned *Aim: Arm*, use it on the Coeurl to disable its attacks temporarily.

You’ll also encounter a creature called a Cream, which resists most physical damage. Instead, target it with Fire-based spells — it’s weak to fire, and a single cast from a Black Mage can either defeat it outright or leave it on the brink. Once the Panthers are eliminated, the rest of the battle will be much easier. Keep chipping away at the remaining monsters until victory is yours.

Instinctively, Marche readies himself, but before he can react, the warp pulls him in and transports him to a mysterious temple-like place.

Disoriented, Marche surveys his surroundings until his eyes land on a glowing crystal ahead. Just as he begins to approach, a commanding voice echoes through the air, demanding to know his name. Nervously, Marche responds — and from the crystal emerges a strange being who identifies himself as **Famfrit**, the Totema guarding this first crystal. Though he doesn’t seem openly hostile at first, Famfrit quickly summons two Floateyes and two Ahrimans to defend the area and challenges Marche to battle.

Your objective is to defeat the boss, Famfrit. If your team is at a decent level, the fight should go smoothly. A good tactic is to inflict Sleep on Famfrit early, then focus on eliminating the lesser monsters while he’s incapacitated. Once the field is clear, have Marche or your strongest attacker close in to strike Famfrit — you’ll even land a free hit as he wakes. Be aware that one of the Ahrimans knows the *Roulette* ability, which can instantly KO a random unit on either side. Stay persistent, manage your positioning carefully, and chip away at Famfrit’s HP until he finally falls.

Whether this Nu Mou is a criminal or just caught in the wrong place at the wrong time remains to be seen.

This fight pits your clan against six enemies. You’ll soon learn that the Nu Mou’s name is **Ezel Berbier**, a renowned Hermetic. He’ll assist you in battle, though he doesn’t actually attack directly. His special ability, *Azoth*, can inflict Sleep on every opponent — but since you can’t control him, whether or not he uses it is unpredictable. You’ll also encounter a new unit type here: the **Illusionist**. Illusionists use *Phantasm* spells that strike every target on the battlefield without needing to aim manually.

The encounter can be difficult, but manageable with the right priorities. If your team has low Magic Resistance, take out the Illusionist first to reduce the field-wide damage. If your squad struggles with physical defense, make the Fighter and Defender your initial targets instead. The Hunter and Ninja positioned toward the back should be dealt with last. Keep your attacks consistent, maintain awareness of your formation, and above all — make sure Ezel survives the battle.

        strategy: `Check the enemy lineup for this mission — it’s entirely made up of monsters, many of which have valuable skills that a Blue Mage or Morpher can learn. Because of this, it’s a good idea to bring along a **Beastmaster** (with a Blue Mage to capture abilities) or a **Hunter** to help manage them. That said, don’t underestimate the fight; it’s tougher than it looks, so field your strongest units alongside your skill-learners.

Most of the enemies are standard monsters, but the **Ice Flan** stands out. As with all Flan types, physical attacks barely hurt it, so rely on magic instead — specifically Fire spells, which it’s weak against. One of your Black Mages should already know *Fire*, making quick work of it. The two **Icedrakes** are especially dangerous, each with distinct skills: one uses *Ice Breath* (a Dragoon-style attack), while the other has *Mighty Guard*. Both pack a serious punch, so approach them carefully.

Start the battle by targeting the **Lamia** and **Ice Flan** with ranged Fire attacks. Once they’re down, focus on eliminating the first Icedrake, then move on to the second. The **Bomb** poses little threat and can be saved for last — it doesn’t offer anything useful for learning or loot. Once the Ice Flan and Icedrakes are gone, the rest of the encounter plays out like a standard monster brawl.

        strategy: `When Marche reaches the Roda Volcano, he immediately starts complaining about the heat. Suddenly, the ground shakes violently, and a dark warp materializes at the center of the area. Marche quickly realizes that this must mean another crystal is nearby—but before he can react, the warp expands and pulls him in.

When the scene fades back in, everything looks completely different from the first crystal encounter. The gloomy, gray tones of the previous temple are replaced with vibrant colors and fluttering butterflies. Marche even comments on how beautiful and peaceful it feels compared to before. But just as he approaches the crystal, several glowing **Ultima Crystals** appear around him. It seems this won’t be as simple as he hoped.

These Ultima Crystals are the Totema themselves, though they differ greatly from Famfrit. They can’t move at all and act more like stationary defenses for the crystal. Their main ability, *Logos*, can Charm units and lower both Attack and Defense, making it extremely irritating to deal with.

Fortunately, there’s a simple strategy to make this battle easy. Move one of your units directly adjacent to an Ultima Crystal while staying out of range of the others. The Crystals won’t use *Logos* unless your character is at least one tile away, so standing right next to them forces them to rely on their weak physical attack instead. As long as you assign only one unit to each Crystal, they won’t resort to *Logos*.

Focus on taking down one Crystal at a time while keeping your team spread out to avoid overlapping attack ranges. The first one you destroy will likely be the most difficult since safe positions are limited, but once it’s gone, the rest will fall easily. Keep your formation disciplined and avoid bunching up, and you’ll clear the battle smoothly with minimal damage to your team.

You’ll be facing **seven enemies** in this mission, all fairly strong in their own ways. With only five of your own units (including Marche), you’ll be at a numerical disadvantage. That said, if you focus on the biggest threats first, the fight becomes much more manageable. It’s also worth dedicating one slot to a **White Mage** for healing support.

At the start of the battle, the two **Thieves** will likely move first. They’re not particularly dangerous, so you can safely ignore them early on unless you’re worried about stolen items—in which case, inflicting **Blind** on them is a good precaution. The **Sniper** can deal some damage but doesn’t have many abilities to worry about. The **Archer**, however, should be taken out quickly to prevent her from using debilitating attacks like *Aim: Arm* or *Aim: Legs*.

The remaining enemies are all **magic users**, which gives you a big tactical opening. If possible, bring a **Templar** or anyone capable of casting **Silence**. The **Time Mage**, **Summoner**, and **Black Mage** become completely harmless once Silenced, so keep that status effect active while you focus on other targets. Deal with the melee units first, then clean up the spellcasters once the field is under control.

Although you’re outnumbered, smart use of **status effects** can easily turn the tide. Rely on **Blind**, **Silence**, and other disabling abilities to keep enemies locked down for several turns. With careful planning and steady control, this battle becomes much smoother—and victory is well within reach.

        ],
        strategy: `Marche cautiously enters the Salika Keep, searching for the rumored giant emerald crystal. As he climbs the steps, he begins to suspect that this might be one of the sacred crystals he’s been seeking. Suddenly, a voice calls out from ahead, and as the camera pans, it becomes clear that Babus has arrived under direct orders from Prince Mewt. Babus accuses Marche of being a threat to the Prince, and though Marche tries to deny it, his own conscience betrays him. When he admits he didn’t realize this world belonged to Mewt, Babus immediately understands the truth. With that, his forces prepare for combat—and so must you.

You can field five additional units alongside Marche for this battle. The fight ahead is one of the tougher ones so far, so make sure you deploy your strongest team.

Babus the Runeseeker is the biggest challenge in this encounter. His unique skillset includes Explode, a powerful area attack similar to the Sage’s Giga Flare; Stillness, which inflicts Stop; and Quarter, which removes one-fourth of a target’s HP. He also has the Counter reaction ability, making him risky to engage up close.

Backing him up are two Templars, a Bishop, an Alchemist, and a Moogle Gunner. The Templars are dangerous physical fighters. One uses Rasp to drain MP, Cheer to raise Attack, and Haste, along with the Bonecrusher reaction ability. The other Templar has Astra to block status effects, Warcry to lower Speed, Cheer again to raise Attack, and the Weapon Atk+ support ability.

The Bishop is a balanced unit capable of healing allies, removing buffs with Dispel, and dealing damage. Taking him out early will cut off their healing options. The Alchemist is much more offensive, using Flare and Frog—silence or eliminate him quickly before he causes trouble. The Moogle Gunner stays toward the back and relies on Stopshot paired with Concentrate; Blinding him early helps neutralize that threat.

Your main goal is to defeat Babus. If your team is strong enough, focus entirely on him to end the battle quickly. Otherwise, remove the supporting enemies first to make things safer. Keep your party spread out to avoid Babus’s area attacks and use status effects like Silence or Stop to limit his magic. With good positioning and focused attacks, you’ll bring down Babus and complete the mission at Salika Keep.

        strategy: `For this next story mission, Marche ventures into the Nargai Cave to investigate rumors of a ghost. A small glowing orb appears before him, and instead of fear, he feels strangely calm. “Funny,” he says, “here I am looking at a ghost, but I don’t feel scared at all.” The orb begins to move deeper into the cave, and Marche, curious, follows it—only to be caught off guard when a warp suddenly engulfs him.

When the scene fades back in, Marche finds himself in another temple—clearly the site of another crystal. The ghost briefly vanishes, then reappears near the crystal. From it emerges the Totema **Adrammelech**, who absorbs the ghost and declares that no one may approach his masters’ domain. Unfazed, Marche readies himself for battle as Adrammelech summons his dragon minions.

This fight is a significant jump in difficulty compared to the earlier Totema encounters. Bring a strong party of six, including a White Mage or similar support unit. The dragons don’t have high Speed, so you’ll likely move first, but their power should not be underestimated.

You’ll face three dragons: a **Firewyrm**, **Icedrake**, and **Thundrake**. Each uses its respective elemental breath attack—*Fire Breath*, *Ice Breath*, and *Bolt Breath*. The Icedrake may also use *Mighty Guard* to boost its allies’ defenses. Some dragons have *Geomancy* or *Weapon Atk+* to enhance their magic or physical strength, but they’re manageable if controlled early.

Adrammelech himself is the real threat. His signature move, *Firestream*, deals massive fire-elemental damage—roughly twice as strong as Famfrit’s *Breath of God*. He also uses *Lightspeed* to ignore reaction abilities, *Howl of Rage* to reduce Speed for nearby units, and *Soul Sphere* to drain MP, so keep your spellcasters at a distance.

To gain control of the battle, open by inflicting **Disable**, **Immobilize**, or **Blind** on the dragons to keep them from interfering. Once they’re under control, direct your full attention to Adrammelech. Concentrate your strongest melee attackers on him while your support units focus on healing and buffs. With steady pressure and a few well-timed strikes, you’ll bring down this formidable Bangaa Totema and claim victory over the crystal.

Because of the danger here, it’s smart to bring a White Mage or another unit capable of reviving allies. Phoenix Downs are also essential. Make sure your team has strong defenses—Paladins or Defenders are perfect for this battle. You’ll want to play carefully and avoid unnecessary risks.

The enemies here are mostly clan units, with a few monsters mixed in. Right in front of you are a Ninja, a Blue Mage, and a Hunter. The Ninja uses Metal Veil, Water Veil, and Double Sword, letting him strike twice in one turn. The Blue Mage knows a wide range of powerful techniques, including Mighty Guard, Night, Hastebreak, White Wind, and several monster-based skills. The Hunter has solid attack stats and uses Sonic Boom, Advice, and Aim: Vitals, which can inflict random status effects.

To your left is an Assassin, easily one of the most dangerous enemies in the group. She uses Shadowbind to immobilize targets, Aphonia to silence, Oblivion to cause Addle, and Last Breath to instantly KO her target—a deadly ability in a Jagd. Avoid targeting her with arrows, as she can reflect them back.

There’s also an Antlion and a Toughskin among the enemy ranks. The Antlion can use LV3 Def-less to lower the defenses of units whose levels are divisible by three and Sandstorm to inflict Blind. The Toughskin isn’t too threatening, relying mostly on Resonate and Matra Magic, both of which are manageable.

Your best move is to take down the Assassin and Ninja first, as they pose the greatest threat. Watch for Last Breath in particular—it’s an instant KO, and in a Jagd, that means permanent loss if you don’t revive in time. After that, focus on the Hunter to prevent status ailments, then eliminate the Blue Mage. This battle is tough, so don’t worry if you need a few tries to get it right. It’s your first real Jagd mission, and surviving it is an accomplishment in itself.

At first, things seem calm, but one of their members suddenly recognizes Marche, saying he looks exactly like the bounty they’ve been hunting. Turns out, you’re the target.

So much for helping them out—since surrender isn’t an option, it’s time to fight your way through. Hopefully, you brought a healer and maybe some ranged attackers, because this group is no joke.

Your enemies include a **Sage**, **Paladin**, **Fighter**, **Red Mage**, **Time Mage**, and **Black Mage**. The Paladin may seem like the biggest threat with his strong attack power, but his skillset is limited—he only uses *Saint Cross* and *Drop Weapon*. He can heal, though he rarely bothers to.

The **Fighter** is much more dangerous physically. His high Weapon Attack and standard Fighter techniques make him a prime candidate to take down early. On the magical side, the **Black Mage** is the most destructive. With Magic Power around the 200 range and access to “-aga” level spells, he can hit incredibly hard if left alone.

The **Sage** could have been trouble, but this one’s weaker than most. Thankfully, he doesn’t know *Giga Flare*. He does have *Reflex*, which blocks basic Fight attacks, so make sure to use abilities or magic to deal with him. The **Red Mage** isn’t much of a problem either—she lacks *Doublecast* and doesn’t have the stats to make an impact. The **Time Mage** can be annoying, though, especially if he uses *Quicken* to speed up the Fighter right after you’ve taken damage. That combo can turn deadly fast.

Your best opening move is to **Disable** the Fighter and Paladin to neutralize their melee threat. After that, **Silence** the casters to limit their magic output. A utility unit that can inflict those conditions will make this battle far easier, supported by your strongest physical and magical attackers, plus a healer for backup.

If you play carefully and avoid rushing in, this fight isn’t too difficult, especially for a story mission. But if you charge in without a plan, Clan Ox will quickly overwhelm you. Stay composed, control the field, and you’ll walk away from this one without much trouble.

Ritz calls out the Golden Clock forgers, revealing your next fight. Once again, you’ll be battling alongside Ritz and Shara. With both of them on your side and only four enemies to face, this mission should be fairly easy. Bring three extra units and begin the battle.

The enemies include an Alchemist, a Juggler, a Time Mage, and a Gadgeteer. The Alchemist can use Meteor for heavy damage, Poison to slowly drain HP, and Toad to turn units into frogs. The Juggler uses Hurl to throw items, Firebomb to cause Berserk, and Ball to inflict Confusion.

The Time Mage can be troublesome if left unchecked. Demi deals strong damage against high-HP units, Quicken grants free turns to allies, and Slow or Stop can leave your team helpless if you aren’t careful.

The Gadgeteer’s attacks are random and risky for both sides. Red Spring can cast Haste on a random team, Blue Screw removes buffs with Dispel, and Green Gear inflicts Poison—all based on chance. Its Damage > MP ability also makes it more resistant to direct attacks.

Thanks to Ritz and Shara’s high levels and strong skills, this battle shouldn’t give you much trouble. Just stay alert—if either of them is KOed, things can turn quickly. Stay focused, finish the enemies off, and the mission will be over before long.

        strategy: `As you enter Muscadet, an engagement is about to occur. Marche and Montblanc 
appear in the area and witness some Judges and officers of the law bringing 
in random units for questioning. A particular arguement between a Moogle and a
Judge will appear on-screen. The Moogle will ask why he is to be brought in, 
and Judge responds with that the human they are looking for has been seen 
with a Moogle. Unable to take this injustice, Marche runs in...

The first thing he does is exclaim that he is the one Prince Mewt is looking 
for. While the Judge is a bit disbelieving, he still brings in units to 
capture this supposed boy. Units begin to move in, and you will note that you 
are a bit outnumbered. Bring in three extra units with addition to Marche and 
Montblanc and begin the battle with the odds of 5 vs. 7 stacked against you.

Your enemies consist of some powerful units, but the most dangerous of them 
all would be the Paladin or the two Templars. If you care to steal anything, 
you will definitely want the Dragon Mail or Genji Armor. The first enemy unit 
to move will probably be the enemy Paladin or either Mog Knight, but if you 
brought in swift units, you should be able to move first for the most part. 

The two Templars are dangerous with both of them holding the R-Ability, 
Bonecrusher. In addition, both Templars can terrorize you with Astra, Warcry, 
Rasp, Haste, and Lifebreak which can deal incredible damage when you knock off 
a lot of that Templar's HP. The second most dangerous, the Paladin lacks in 
numbers of abilities, but don't let that get your guard off. Holy Blade does 
incredible damage, and Drop Weapon can become annoying.

Also included are two Mog Knights, a Gunner, and a Sage. The Mog Knights are 
pretty much standard issue and shouldn't provide much problems with only Mog 
Attack, Mog Guard, Mog Rush, Mog Lance, Mog Shield, and Mog Aid. By now, you 
should already have many ways to counter-act these kind of abilities. The Sage
is almost laughable with only Drain, Aero, and Bio. Finally, the Gunner isn't 
dangerous as it hasn't learned Concentrate.

At the beginning, begin Disabling and/or Immobilizing the Templar and Bishop 
immediately. Using status ailments can easily turn the tide of battle with 
you. Following, you will want to Blind the Gunner. Deal with the opponents as 
you see fit, but you should try to set up an attack which you know won't fail 
before you attempt something rash. 

But the battle isn't over just yet...

Afterwards, Judgemaster Cid appears on the scene, and begins to question you.
Pretty sure that the boy is the boy, Cid brings him to the prison. There, 
Babus will run in and confirm that the boy is indeed Marche. Now that they 
know, Marche demands that Judgemaster Cid let the others go. Cid will ask 
Marche if he is the one destroying the crystals. Marche confirms, and a seam 
appears mysteriously. Somehow...

The fourth crystal is weak... But you have no access to your clan as of now. 
Babus and Cid are also in the area, and they aren't about to let you destroy 
these crystals in which they had so willingly defended. You guessed it, it's 
another fight with Runeseeker Babus, and this time, he's even more tough. The 
only opposition you will receive here is from Babus. The Totema is weak, and
it can't attack. Since Cid is a Judgemaster (obviously), he will play as Judge 
to make sure the Laws are enforced. Babus is no laughing matter however. This 
battle is a one vs. one... Babus vs. Marche.

Babus's abilities consist of Explode, a deadly Fire elemental move, Stillness, 
which Stops Marche right in his tracks, and Demi which cuts off half of your 
HP right off the bat. In addition, Counter and Weapon Def+ makes him even more 
of an adversary. The key here is to avoid his first move, and follow-up with a 
heavy damage move which you should have at this point for a physical character 
as Marche. Holy Blade or Beatdown would work. However, if you don't have 
access to them, you might have to pick away at Babus's health continuously and
use X-Potions constantly. Defeat Babus and the Fruits to win.

        strategy: `This time, the story doesn’t open with Marche entering the area. Instead, the camera pans over the battlefield where a short exchange takes place between a group of Fighters and their companions. One of them mentions something about a kid being late, hinting that an ambush is about to unfold. A scout Thief soon arrives and announces that their “pot of gold” has shown up.

Right on cue, Marche walks in — and of course, he’s the target. Despite being surrounded by six enemies, he barely reacts, muttering only a casual “Huh?” before the fight begins. You’ll be facing six opponents this time, so bring five reliable, well-balanced units and get ready for battle.

Your enemies include two Fighters, two Thieves, and two Bishops. It’s a straightforward mix, but you’ll still need to be cautious. **Strikeback** and **Bonecrusher** are the two abilities that can punish reckless attacks, so avoid hitting when your accuracy is low. A missed swing could mean taking heavy counter damage.

The **Fighters** come with a range of attacks: Rush, Air Render, Far Fist, Wild Swing, Beatdown, and Blitz. Fortunately, these skills are divided between the two of them. If you take down the Fighter with *Wild Swing*, *Far Fist*, and *Beatdown* early, those threats are gone for good.

The **Thieves** are more troublesome due to *Steal: Weapon* and *Steal: Ability*. Losing a weapon or skill mid-battle can make things far harder than necessary. Try to disable or immobilize them from a distance before they get close enough to steal. Other than that, they don’t deal much direct damage.

Lastly, the **Bishops** use low-tier spells like *Water* and *Aero*, with *Holy* being their only significant source of damage. They can also heal with *Cura* and drain JP, but their offense isn’t especially threatening.

The safest plan is to deal with the **Thieves** first so you don’t lose gear or abilities. Once they’re down, turn your focus to the **Fighters**, who will probably be pressing your front line by then. Leave the **Bishops** for last since they don’t pose a major threat.

Overjoyed, Marche calls out to him, but Doned stays silent and runs off. When Marche follows, he finds Doned speaking with a group of strangers—only to realize, in shock, that his brother has just turned him in for a bounty.

The palace still wants you captured, and this enemy clan has come to collect. Since there’s no talking your way out of this, you’ll have to fight through. Bring six units for this battle; your enemies consist of Bangaa and Humans. Apart from the Bishop, the enemy party is entirely physical, so consider bringing some strong magic users like Morphers or Sages. They’ll have enough defense to survive melee hits while exploiting the enemies’ weaker magic resistance.

The **White Monk** at the front uses techniques such as Whirlwind, Air Render, Earth Render, and Far Fist. While his abilities can cover a lot of ground, his weapon attack is low, so his standard hits won’t do much damage. Behind him, a **Gladiator** uses the elemental Spellblade attacks—Fire Sword, Bolt Sword, and Ice Sword—each adding magical damage to his strikes.

Two **Soldiers** make up the human side of the group. The first uses the typical “Break” skills—Powerbreak, Mindbreak, and Magicbreak—and can Berserk your units with Provoke. The other Soldier is less threatening, with only Powerbreak, Mindbreak, and Speedbreak, plus Mug, which steals Gil while dealing light damage.

At the center is a **Defender**, who looks intimidating but isn’t too dangerous once you understand his moves. Tremor pushes back nearby units, Drop Weapon can disarm your characters, and Mow Down deals area damage but leaves him exposed afterward by dropping his Evade to zero. The **Dragoon** is stronger and more annoying, with Lancet to absorb HP and elemental breath attacks like Fire Breath and Bolt Breath.

The **Bishop** is the group’s only magic user. His spells include Water for damage, Dispel to remove buffs, and Break to inflict Petrify. Once the Bishop falls, the enemy loses their only source of healing aside from items.

Start by taking down the Bishop first to eliminate magic and healing threats. After that, shift to the physical attackers—especially the Gladiator and Dragoon. Since most of your enemies have higher weapon defense than magic resistance, magic-based attacks are very effective here. Keep an eye out for the Bishop’s Return Magic ability, though, as it can reflect your spells. Once you stabilize the fight, the remaining enemies will fall quickly, and you’ll come out on top.

Marche has never seen him before and is unsure what to make of this imposing stranger. With a calm but commanding tone, Llednar tells Marche to leave. Before Marche can react, a seam opens in the air nearby.

It’s the location of the fifth and final crystal. Llednar disappears briefly, but as Marche moves forward, he reappears and orders Marche not to proceed any further. When Marche refuses, Llednar strikes, and the battle begins. Just as things look grim, Judgemaster Cid arrives and intervenes. Using an antilaw, Cid bans Llednar’s strongest attack, Omega, but the fight continues regardless. You’ll now have to face Biskmatar Llednar himself.

Llednar summons two Templars and two Titanias, while you can deploy five of your own units. The **Templars** are dangerous front-line fighters with high attack power. Watch for their use of *Silence*, *Soul Sphere*, and *Rasp*, which drain MP. They can also cast *Astra* to nullify status effects, *Lifebreak* to deal damage based on missing HP, and *Warcry* to lower Speed.

The **Titanias** aren’t as physically strong, but their spell *LV?D Holy* can be deadly. If the day of the month matches a unit’s level, that unit will take heavy Holy damage. They can also use *Angel Whisper* to heal and revive allies with Auto-Life.

Llednar himself is the greatest threat. His attack power is incredibly high, and even without Omega, he’s devastating. His abilities include *Abyss* (deals damage and inflicts Poison), *Life Render* (deals damage and inflicts Doom), *Heart Render* (damages MP), *Ripcircle* (damages nearby units), and *Furycircle* (damages and knocks back surrounding units). However, no matter how much damage you deal, Llednar cannot be killed. The only way to win is to defeat his allies and survive until Cid steps in to banish Llednar with a Red Card.

Once Llednar disappears, Marche continues deeper into the dunes, where the final crystal awaits.

Judgemaster Cid gives Marche a chance to leave, but Marche refuses, determined to finish what he started. As he steps into the final chamber, the Totema **Mateus** appears—the Totema of the Humans. Mateus shifts forms, appearing first as Ritz, then Doned, then Mewt, and finally as Marche himself. Recognizing the illusion, Marche steels himself for battle.

The illusionary forms transform into four **Vampires**, while **Mateus** remains at the center. This is the toughest Totema battle yet, so prepare carefully. Bring a **White Mage** to counter the Vampires’ status effects and strong physical attackers to handle Mateus.

The Vampires use dangerous abilities, including *LV? S-Flare*, which deals heavy damage to all units sharing the same last digit in their level. They also use *Zombify* to turn allies into the undead and *Miasma* to poison and damage your team.

Mateus herself is extremely powerful, boasting both HP and Weapon Attack in the 400s. She can easily KO weaker units in one hit. Her moves include *Spellbind* (damage and Slow), *Breath of God* (large area attack), *Star Cross* (Holy-element field damage), and *Thundaga* for direct magical strikes.

Before the fight, cast *Protect* and *Shell* on your team to reduce incoming damage. It’s best to ignore the Vampires if possible—Blind or Disable them to keep them occupied, then focus entirely on Mateus. This battle is a test of endurance and precision rather than strategy. Stay healed, keep your buffs up, and hit hard. With patience and persistence, you’ll finally bring down the last Totema.

        strategy: `Marche discovers a piece of Materite deep within the Materiwood, and for a moment, everything seems to be going smoothly. Just as he starts to relax, a group of Viera bandits appears from behind. Somehow, they knew he was there—and it turns out Doned was the one who tipped them off. There’s no turning back now; it’s time to fight.

You can bring six units into this battle. It’s best to equip gear that protects against status effects, especially instant KO. The **Assassin** is the most dangerous enemy here thanks to her abilities *Shadowbind* and *Last Breath*. *Shadowbind* inflicts Stop, freezing your unit in place, while *Last Breath* causes an instant KO—something you’ll want to avoid at all costs.

The **Sniper** can also be troublesome with her precision attacks. She uses *Aim: Armor*, *Aim: Weapon*, and *Aim: Wallet* to destroy your gear, and *Aim: Weapon* is particularly dangerous since it permanently removes your weapon from battle. If her HP drops too low, she may use *Doom Archer*, dealing damage equal to her lost HP and also draining MP. To avoid this, either defeat her quickly or disable her before she can act.

Several **magic users** make up the rest of the Viera clan. The **Elementalist** uses a variety of Spirit Magic attacks that combine elemental damage with status effects. *Shining Air* deals Wind damage and causes Blind, *Evil Gaze* deals Dark damage and Confuses, *Heavy Dust* uses Earth damage and Immobilizes, and *Sliprain* inflicts Water damage and Slows its target. Unless you have a Status law active, expect her to cause serious disruption.

Behind her is a **Red Mage** capable of *Doublecast*, allowing her to cast two spells per turn. However, if you steal her Madu (Rapier), she’ll lose access to Doublecast entirely since she hasn’t mastered it yet. Even if she keeps it, her spells—*Fire*, *Thunder*, *Sleep*, and *Poison*—aren’t overly threatening. Take her down whenever convenient.

The **Summoner** can devastate clustered units. Her summons affect a large area—two tiles horizontally and vertically, plus one tile diagonally—so avoid grouping up. Her most dangerous summon is *Madeen*, which deals heavy Holy damage. Finally, the **White Mage** supports the group with *Curaga* for healing, *Esuna* to remove status effects, *Auto-Life* for revival, and *Shell* for protection.

It’s up to you how to handle the battle, but a strong approach is to defeat the **Assassin** first to prevent instant KOs, then target the **White Mage** to eliminate the enemy’s healing and revival options. After that, focus on the casters and ranged units as needed. If you want to have some fun, lure the enemies toward the northwest cliff—knocking them off deals heavy damage and makes for an easy cleanup.

        strategy: `After the tense encounter with Doned, Marche and Montblanc still manage to get Nono to craft a special gift in time for Present Day. As the two approach the palace, Montblanc reassures Marche that the palace likely won’t even recognize him. Confident, they proceed forward—Nono’s invention, the “Lugaborg,” should grant them entry without issue.

Inside the palace waiting room, Marche starts to complain about how long they’ve been waiting. Montblanc suggests that something might be wrong, and before long, their suspicions prove correct. A group of palace guards bursts through the door—it seems they’ve learned who you really are. The informant, of course, is none other than Doned.

This fight takes place in a very cramped arena, so positioning will be tricky for both sides. The lack of space makes **area-based magic attacks** extremely effective. A **Summoner** works wonders here—once the enemies group up, unleash *Madeen* or *Ifrit* to hit multiple targets at once. Just make sure you don’t crowd your own units, or you’ll pay for it.

Leading the charge is a **Bangaa Templar**, one of the toughest enemies on the field. He boasts high Weapon Attack and Defense, so disable him early if you can. Avoid physical attacks because of his *Bonecrusher* reaction, which counterattacks for 1.5× damage. His other skills include *Astra* (blocks the next status effect), *Warcry* (lowers nearby Speed), *Rasp* (MP damage), and *Haste*.

The **two Gladiators** hit hard as well. Their *Spellblade* attacks (Fire Sword, Bolt Sword, and Ice Sword) mix physical and elemental damage, while *Rush*, *Beatdown*, and *Blitz* round out their offense. Don’t engage them directly—*Strikeback* will nullify your attack and counter immediately. With Weapon Attack values in the mid-300s, that’s not something you want to risk.

The lone **Moogle Mog Knight** isn’t as dangerous but can still be a nuisance. He uses *Mog Attack*, *Mog Lance*, *Mog Rush*, *Mog Shield*, and *Mog Aid* to push, damage, and heal. Thankfully, he lacks Ultima Charge or a Reaction Ability, so he’s easier to handle.

The **Alchemist** is the only true caster here, and he’s the one to watch out for. *Death* can instantly KO a unit, but if he hasn’t mastered it, stealing his *Life Crosier* removes his access to it entirely. His other abilities include *Flare*, *Poison*, and *Toad*.

Because the battlefield is small, use radius-based attacks and magic to your advantage. The Templar will likely cast *Haste* on allies early, so prioritize disabling or silencing him. The three Bangaa enemies pose the biggest threat due to their high Weapon Attack, so eliminate them first. Once they’re gone, the rest of the fight is straightforward.

After defeating the guards, reinforcements arrive, and things seem hopeless—until **Babus** appears. Instead of attacking, he uses *Stop* on the guards, halting their advance. Confused, Marche asks why he’s helping, and Babus explains that he wants to understand what’s really happening with these two “worlds.”

Babus teleports Marche to the prince’s throne room, where **Mewt** paces nervously. When Babus brings Marche forward, Mewt is furious. Marche tries to reason with him, but it’s too late—**Remedi** appears, consoles her son, and teleports him away, leaving Marche behind.

Llednar reappears soon after, summoned to eliminate Marche. Babus offers to help, but Marche tells him to find Mewt and the Queen instead. You’ll face Llednar alone, and his damage barrier is still active—making him invincible. The goal here isn’t to win, but to **survive five turns**.

Llednar will likely act first. If your Speed is high—such as from leveling as a Thief or Ninja—you might get the opening turn. If not, hope he doesn’t use *Omega* immediately, as it will end the fight instantly. Keep your distance at all times, since *Omega* only works at close range.

If you survive the opening, move to the farthest possible spot to force Llednar into using *Abyss*, which deals damage and inflicts Poison—something easily cured with items. Continue running for five turns until Judgemaster Cid arrives to stop the fight, ending the encounter.

        strategy: `Now that mythril hunting is underway, it’s no surprise that Doned decides to interfere again. Marche enters Tubola Cave, pretending to be searching for mythril, when a voice suddenly echoes through the cavern—“Stop! Thief!” Confused, Marche looks around as a group of enemies confronts him, accusing him of stealing their mythril. It quickly becomes clear that Doned has sold him out once more. With no escape route, Marche has no choice but to fight.

When deploying your team, spread them out to cover both sides of the field—three units on each flank—since enemies will attack from both directions. The first to act is likely the **Moogle Juggler**, who wields one of the strongest knives in the game. You can easily neutralize him by stealing his weapon. Be cautious of *Dagger*, which damages and inflicts Disable, *Firebomb*, which causes Berserk and deals damage, and *Smile*, which grants an ally an immediate extra turn.

The **Sage** is the biggest magical threat. His *Giga Flare* spell is one of the most powerful in the game—second only to Ultima Blow—and can devastate multiple units if they’re grouped together. Keep your formation loose to minimize damage. On the same side, the **Mog Knight** relies mostly on defensive and support skills like *Mog Guard* for protection, *Mog Shield* to nullify a status ailment, *Mog Peek* to reveal hidden items, *Mog Rush* for high damage at low accuracy, and *Mog Aid* for healing.

To the west, a **Bangaa White Monk** leads the enemy charge. His *Earth Render* attack hits every unit in a straight line ahead, so avoid lining up your characters. He can also revive fallen allies with *Revive*. Supporting him is a **Moogle Animist**, whose *Tail Wag* can Charm targets and *Friend* produces random effects—some beneficial, some harmful. Rounding out the group is a **Blue Mage**, capable of several dangerous skills: *Twister* halves HP instantly, *Bad Breath* inflicts multiple status effects, *Roulette* randomly KOs a unit, and *White Wind* heals allies based on the user’s remaining HP.

Overall, this fight isn’t especially difficult, but the **Sage** and **Blue Mage** can cause trouble if ignored. To neutralize them, use Law Cards—ban *Color Magic* to cripple the Blue Mage, or ban *Skills* to prevent the Sage from using his Sagacity abilities. Once they’re disabled, the rest of the battle is straightforward. The real challenges, as Marche will soon learn, are still to come.

        strategy: `On the road to the Deti Plains, Marche encounters a group of monsters blocking the path. You should know the drill by now—bring five more units alongside Marche and prepare for a fight. Before reaching Judgemaster Cid, you’ll have to deal with this monster threat first. Since this is a story mission, expect the enemies to be stronger than those in standard encounters, but nothing unmanageable if you stay focused.

The first enemy you’ll see is a **Coeurl**, standing ready near the front. Its main ability, *Blaster*, is dangerous because it can Petrify a unit from range. Keeping your distance doesn’t guarantee safety, so it’s best to eliminate the Coeurl early before it can act. Its regular attacks also hit hard, so removing it from the field will make moving forward much safer.

As you progress toward the bottom area near the waterfall, you’ll likely run into a **Jawbreaker**. These creatures love to slow you down, and their *LV3 Def-less* and *LV5 Death* abilities can be deadly if your units’ levels match those numbers. *LV3 Def-less* lowers both Defense and Resistance, while *LV5 Death* instantly KOs all affected units. Both have perfect accuracy when the condition is met, so check your levels before entering.

Moving west and climbing the steps to the higher level, you’ll encounter a **Big Malboro**. Its infamous *Bad Breath* attack can inflict multiple status ailments at once, while *Soundwave* removes your buffs. Above that area, a **Lilith** waits. Her *Twister* ability hits for heavy damage, *Poison Frog* both poisons and transforms a unit, and *Kiss* can inflict Doom or Charm—so keep your distance and take her down quickly.

It’s best to clear this mission in order, working from front to back. The monsters generally stay in their sections of the map, so advancing steadily will keep you from getting overwhelmed. Unless you have **Galmia Shoes**—which let you jump the cliff—you’ll have to take the winding path anyway. Finish the battle by defeating the **Thundrake**, who uses *Bolt Breath* and *Geomancy* for magic-based damage. By that point, if most of your team is still standing, it should go down easily and wrap up the fight.

        enemies: [`Summoner`],
        strategy: `Our final stop before heading to Ambervale is **Siena Gorge**, where we need to collect amber for Judgemaster Cid so he can craft the next antilaw. As Marche enters the gorge, he spots a pink-haired girl standing proudly atop a high ridge—**Ritz**, with **Shara** by her side. With a hint of amusement, Ritz remarks that facing Marche in battle feels oddly fitting.

It’s a long-awaited confrontation. Ritz never wanted to return home, so this clash was inevitable. Marche realizes there’s no avoiding what’s about to happen: for this mission, the two are no longer allies. Bring five additional units and prepare for an emotional, challenging engagement.

This is your first real fight against Ritz’s clan, which is composed entirely of **Viera**. Her team has a strong balance between physical and magical units, so it’s smart to mirror that setup. At the start, advance up the hill but stop short of the wooden bridge—if you move too far, you’ll risk clogging the path and losing maneuverability. Hold your ground and let Ritz’s team close the distance.

The **Assassin** will likely move first. With 200 Speed and Ninja Tabi boosting her movement by six tiles, she can strike fast and far. Don’t let her get behind you—her *Last Breath* attack causes instant KOs. *Aphonia* Silences magic users, *Rockseal* Petrifies, and *Oblivion* inflicts Addle, disabling skill use. Neutralize her early before she can start picking your units off.

Next comes the **Fencer**, who isn’t too threatening. Her *Swallowtail* attack hits surrounding targets, *Piercethrough* stabs two units in a line, and *Nighthawk* provides a ranged strike. She’s manageable if you keep your defenses up.

The **Summoner** is much more dangerous. Her *Madeen* summon inflicts massive Holy damage over a wide radius—two tiles in every direction plus one diagonally—so never bunch your units together. Spread out and take her down before she gets too many casts off.

The **Elementalist** can also make things difficult with her status-inflicting elemental spells. *Fire Whip* damages and Disables, *Shining Air* deals Wind damage and causes Blind, and *Heavy Dust* delivers Earth damage and Immobilizes. *Elementalshift* is especially dangerous, as it alters elemental affinities and can leave your units weak to follow-up attacks.

Ritz’s right-hand fighter is a **Sniper** with powerful ranged attacks. Her *Death Sickle* causes Doom, *Doom Archer* inflicts damage based on lost HP, and *Aim: Weapon* or *Aim: Armor* permanently destroy your gear. If possible, use a Law Card to ban missile attacks entirely—otherwise, focus her down early to protect your equipment.

Finally, there’s **Ritz** herself, serving as a **Red Mage**. She won’t rely on physical attacks; instead, her *Doublecast* ability allows her to chain two spells per turn—*Fire*, *Thunder*, or *Blizzard*—with enhanced damage thanks to *Magic Pow+*. Watch for her “Sleep + Magic” combo, which can easily wipe out vulnerable units. Silencing her won’t help, as her *Ribbon* makes her immune to status ailments.

The goal here is simple: **defeat Ritz**. She starts near the front, so rushing her is a viable strategy. However, you might want to take the time to **Steal** some of the rare gear in this fight, including **Max’s Oathbow**, **SeventhHeaven**, and **Ritz’s Femme Fatale**—all excellent items worth acquiring.

When Ritz finally falls, the gorge will fall silent. The path to Ambervale—and your next step toward ending this world—now lies open.

        strategy: `After overcoming countless challenges, Marche finally arrives at Ambervale, the Royal Valley. As he walks through the palace alongside Judgemaster Cid, he admires the beauty of the place. The peace doesn’t last long, though—up ahead, they find Babus lying unconscious. A familiar voice echoes through the hall, revealing that he’s not dead… yet. It’s Llednar.

Llednar stands in their way once again, ready for battle. Cid immediately uses a special Law Card to cancel the laws protecting him, shattering his barrier and making him vulnerable for the first time. This time, there’s no running—Marche has to defeat him. You can bring three additional units, and it’s smart to include a White Mage for healing support.

Llednar’s team includes a Ninja, Gunner, Assassin, Alchemist, and Illusionist. The Ninja is the biggest threat with Double Sword, striking twice with powerful Katanas. He also uses elemental Veils—Fire, Earth, and Water—to cause Confusion, Slow, and Silence. Oblivion can Addle a unit, preventing it from using any actions. The Gunner can inflict Charm, Blind, Silence, or Stop, but he’s not too dangerous since he lacks Concentrate. The Assassin can still be troublesome with Nightmare and Rockseal but doesn’t have Last Breath, making her easier to handle.

The Alchemist can instantly KO with Death or cause major damage with Flare and Toad, which turns units into frogs. The Illusionist attacks everyone at once using Phantasm Magic like Prominence, Tempest, Stardust, Soil Evidence, and Wild Tornado—all dealing elemental damage to every unit on the field.

Now that Llednar can actually be hurt, the real challenge begins. He carries Excalibur and wears the rare Peytral armor. His attacks are devastating—Omega can instantly wipe out a unit, Life Render inflicts Doom, and Furycircle damages and pushes back surrounding units. Focus your efforts on surviving his heavy hits and striking him hard between turns. Once Llednar is defeated, he finally falls for good.

After the fight, Babus wakes up. Marche helps him up, but Babus is too weak to continue and stays behind as Marche and Cid head deeper into the palace. Inside, they find Queen Remedi, who reminds Marche that this world is still an illusion. Marche admits that he likes this world but knows it isn’t real. Suddenly, Mewt’s voice rings out, and he appears in the statue’s hand, unwilling to leave.

Remedi transforms into her Battle Queen form, summoning two Dephs—Famfrit and Adrammelech—to fight for her. The recreated Famfrit uses Breath of God for massive damage, Lightspeed to bypass reactions, and Demi to cut HP in half. Adrammelech uses Firestream to scorch everything in front of him, Howl of Rage to lower Speed, and hard-hitting physical attacks that can drop units quickly.

Remedi herself is physically strong but has no special abilities in this form. Focus on defeating Famfrit and Adrammelech first, then turn all your attacks on her. When she falls, it seems the fight is finally over—but it’s not.

Queen Remedi rises again, revealing her true self—Li-Grim, the embodiment of the world’s illusion. She summons two Mateuses to aid her in the final battle. The Mateuses use Spellbind to Slow and damage, Breath of God for massive area damage, Star Cross for Holy attacks, and Thundaga for powerful lightning strikes.

Li-Grim herself uses unpredictable abilities. Lawshift changes the laws mid-battle, Amber Gleam dispels your buffs, and Ricca attacks with both Omega and Alpha, the latter being even stronger. She can also summon random Totema with Descent or unleash Magi for extreme damage.

To win, focus all your attacks on Li-Grim. The Mateuses are dangerous, but wasting time on them gives her more chances to use Omega and Alpha. This final fight is about endurance and strength. Defeat Li-Grim—and the illusionary world will finally dissolve.
