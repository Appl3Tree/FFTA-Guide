## 🌟 About the Project

This project started as a personal “handbook” while replaying *Final Fantasy Tactics Advance*. The game has a lot of easy-to-miss details, obscure mechanics, and limited-time opportunities — and flipping between multiple tabs, wikis, and forum threads was getting messy.

So I built a single, organized guide that combines information from multiple sources (community guides, the FFTA wiki, and archived forum posts) into one place.  

It’s built with **React**, and it also happens to be my **first real web development project** — I learned the basics as I went, using AI assistance and lots of trial and error. The result is a simple, functional site that lets you browse, track progress, and dig into FFTA’s hidden details without spoilers unless you choose to expand sections.
